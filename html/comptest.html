    <p class='section-caption'>The Yu Lab's research is focused on unlocking the full potential of C-H activation by overcoming fundamental challenges in reactivity, enantioselectivity, site-selectivity, and sustainability through innovative catalyst and ligand design.</p>
    <p class='body-text'>C-H activation has long been recognized as a powerful route to efficient and sustainable molecular synthesis, but its potential remains limited by fundamental obstacles that differ across its two major subfields: alkane functionalization and the further functionalization of complex, synthetically useful substrates. To make the latter broadly practical, the field must overcome four core challenges—reactivity, enantioselectivity, site-selectivity, and sustainability—which persist due to the inherent similarity of most C-H bonds, the lack of effective stereocontrol models, and the need for ligands that can accelerate these reactions.</p>

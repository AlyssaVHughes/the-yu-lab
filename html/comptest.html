    <p class='section-caption'>The Yu Lab's research is focused on unlocking the full potential of C-H activation by overcoming fundamental challenges in reactivity, enantioselectivity, site-selectivity, and sustainability through innovative catalyst and ligand design.</p>
    <p class='body-text'>C-H activation has long been recognized as a powerful route to efficient and sustainable molecular synthesis, but its potential remains limited by fundamental obstacles that differ across its two major subfields: alkane functionalization and the further functionalization of complex, synthetically useful substrates. To make the latter broadly practical, the field must overcome four core challenges—reactivity, enantioselectivity, site-selectivity, and sustainability—which persist due to the inherent similarity of most C-H bonds, the lack of effective stereocontrol models, and the need for ligands that can accelerate these reactions.</p>

              <p class="body-text">Jin-Quan Yu (余金权), born in 1966 in Zhejiang, China, is a Chinese-born American chemist known for transforming the field of C-H activation. His methods allow chemists to turn inert carbon-hydrogen bonds into powerful building blocks for drugs and other complex molecules.<br><br>
                                  After completing his B.Sc. and M.Sc. in China, he earned his Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge in 1999. He then conducted postdoctoral research at Harvard with E. J. Corey before returning to Cambridge as a Junior Research Fellow.<br><br>
                                  Yu began his independent career in 2003 and later joined Scripps Research, where he became a full professor and now holds the Frank and Bertha Hupp Professorship. His pioneering work on weakly coordinating, remote, and asymmetric C-H activation has set new standards for selectivity in organic synthesis.<br><br>
                                  His contributions have earned him major honors, including the 2016 MacArthur Fellowship and membership in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He also co-founded Vividion Therapeutics, extending the impact of his research into biotechnology and drug discovery.</p>
